Thanks for clarifying. If I do v3 I will try to present things in a way that clearly
answers the questions you have raised here about IGD and provide more information
about IGD than I did in v1/v2 for those who don't know all the details of it.

If I do a v3, you will of course be on the Cc list since I expect you will be one of
the maintainers of the affected code.
