However, there is one advantage, from the viewpoint of the Xen virtualization platform
as a whole, to do the patching of the OpRegion in hvmloader instead of in the DM.

If we patch the OpRegion in hvmloader as v2 of this patch does, we provide a common
solution for extended VBT support for Intel IGD devices that would be compatible with
all DM implementations, not just with Qemu. So why not do the patching of the OpRegion
in hvmloader?
