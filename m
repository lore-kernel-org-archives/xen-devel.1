This is what I don't understand about your objection to how both the current
implementation and my proposed changes makes the host OpRegion accessible to
the guest. What do you mean when you say any MMIO and I/O ports assigned to
a guest are also assigned to its DM? What does it mean to assign an MMIO
region to a DM? Is it the DM you mean or the DM domain, which need not be
dom0 if we are running the device model in an unprivileged domain. I also
am presuming you know that dom0 for Intel IGD passthrough is a PV dom0,
not a PVH dom0. I have never tried Intel IGD passthrough with a PVH dom0,
because as far as I can tell vt-d is not supported with PVH dom0.

Take a look at this code from our current implementation in qemu-xen. This
is from the current master branch of qemu-xen on xenbits.xen.org, the
hw/xen/xen_pt_graphics.c file, the igd_write_opregion function:

    int ret;

    if (igd_guest_opregion) {
        XEN_PT_LOG(&s->dev, "opregion register already been set, ignoring %x\n",
                   val);
        return;
    }

    /* We just work with LE. */
    xen_host_pci_get_block(&s->real_device, XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION,
            (uint8_t *)&igd_host_opregion, 4);
    igd_guest_opregion = (unsigned long)(val & ~XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_MASK)
                            | (igd_host_opregion & XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_MASK);

    ret = xc_domain_iomem_permission(xen_xc, xen_domid,
            (unsigned long)(igd_host_opregion >> XC_PAGE_SHIFT),
            XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_PAGES,
            XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_ENABLE_ACCESSED);

    if (ret) {
        XEN_PT_ERR(&s->dev, "[%d]:Can't enable to access IGD host opregion:"
                    " 0x%lx.\n", ret,
                    (unsigned long)(igd_host_opregion >> XC_PAGE_SHIFT)),
        igd_guest_opregion = 0;
        return;
    }

    ret = xc_domain_memory_mapping(xen_xc, xen_domid,
            (unsigned long)(igd_guest_opregion >> XC_PAGE_SHIFT),

This function is called when the guest (i.e. hvmloader, seabios/ovmf, or
guest kernel code) tries to access (write to) what is known as the ASLS
register in the PCI config space of the Intel IGD. The config space is
256 bytes long, and the ASLS register is the last four bytes of that space
according to the proprietary spec from Intel for the OpRegion. So the address
for the ASLS register in the config space is 0xfc, and the four bytes stored
there is supposed to be the address of the OpRegion according to Intel's spec.
That is fundamentally what we are trying to do here - program that ASLS register
so it points to the location, in the guest, of the OpRegion. If you examine
the code above, you will notice the call to xen_host_pci_get_block(), with
XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION as one of the parameters. Did you look up its value?
It is 0xfc, the value for the ASLS register in the Intel spec. How does the
DM, qemu-xen, get the value stored there? Well, the xen_host_pci_get_block()
function accesses the PCI config space from the device model not directly as
kernel code or platform firmware code such as hvmloader or OVMF/Seabios could,
but only indirectly, through the 256-byte config file that is exposed by the
Linux kernel sysfs interface at /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/config in
the Linux host filesystem. If you don't believe me, take a look at the code
in hw/xen/xen-host-pci-device.c where the xen_host_pci_get_block() function is
implemented in qemu-xen.

So the device model can, indirectly, access the PCI device's config space
because the Linux kernel exposes it via the sysfs interface. The point is,
the DM's access to these resources of the passed through PCI device has
nothing to do with MMIO or I/O port mappings, but is entirely dependent on
the host dom0 kernel for access. But sysfs does not provide access to the
OpRegion, that is, the actual two pages that comprise the OpRegion whose
base address is the value stored in the ASLS register. That is fundamentally
why the DM does not have access to the OpRegion.

Do you understand now?
