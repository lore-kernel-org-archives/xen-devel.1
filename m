From: Jack Allister <jalliste@amazon.com>

In the common case (where kvm->arch.use_master_clock is true), the KVM
clock is defined as a simple arithmetic function of the guest TSC, based
on a reference point stored in kvm->arch.master_kernel_ns and
kvm->arch.master_cycle_now.

The existing KVM_[GS]ET_CLOCK functionality does not allow for this
relationship to be precisely saved and restored by userspace. All it can
currently do is set the KVM clock at a given UTC reference time, which
is necessarily imprecise.

So on live update, the guest TSC can remain cycle accurate at precisely
the same offset from the host TSC, but there is no way for userspace to
restore the KVM clock accurately.

Even on live migration to a new host, where the accuracy of the guest
time-keeping is fundamentally limited by the accuracy of wallclock
synchronization between the source and destination hosts, the clock jump
experienced by the guest's TSC and its KVM clock should at least be
*consistent*. Even when the guest TSC suffers a discontinuity, its KVM
clock should still remain the *same* arithmetic function of the guest
TSC, and not suffer an *additional* discontinuity.

To allow for accurate migration of the KVM clock, add per-vCPU ioctls
which save and restore the actual PV clock info in
pvclock_vcpu_time_info.

The restoration in KVM_SET_CLOCK_GUEST works by creating a new reference
point in time just as kvm_update_masterclock() does, and calculating the
corresponding guest TSC value. This guest TSC value is then passed
through the user-provided pvclock structure to generate the *intended*
KVM clock value at that point in time, and through the *actual* KVM
clock calculation. Then kvm->arch.kvmclock_offset is adjusted to
eliminate the difference.

Both ioctls return -ENODATA when the KVM clock is not in master clock
mode (because the host TSC is unreliable, or the guest TSCs are
configured strangely); the KVM clock is then not a function of the
guest TSC at all, so userspace shall fall back to the legacy
KVM_[GS]ET_CLOCK, whose imprecision is acceptable in a mode which is
imprecise anyway. That means sending the results of *both* GET ioctls
with the migration data, unless the intent is to refuse to resume on a
host with a bad TSC. An unknown TSC frequency on the current CPU
(possible only without CONSTANT_TSC) also reads as -ENODATA. The
ioctls are advertised with KVM_CAP_CLOCK_GUEST.

KVM_GET_CLOCK_GUEST services a masterclock update pending on the vCPU
before reading: a backwards host TSC on resume parks the request and
leaves the snapshot stale, while vcpu_load() has already applied the
offset compensation — combining the two yields a value whose frequency
still matches, which the destination could not reject. Servicing the
update makes that case correctly return -ENODATA.

The set side validates everything it is given — padding, version (must
be zero), flags (nothing beyond PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT) — so the fields
keep meaning for the future, and re-marks the Hyper-V TSC page once the
new clock is published, with a consumer queued behind the re-mark, as
kvm_update_masterclock() does.

+:Architectures: x86_64
+:Type: vcpu ioctl
+:Parameters: struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info (out)
+:Returns: 0 on success, <0 on error
+
+Retrieves the current time information structure used for KVM/PV clocks,
+in precisely the form advertised to the guest vCPU, which gives parameters
+for a direct conversion from a guest TSC value to nanoseconds.
+
+The structure is in terms of the given vCPU's TSC. It must be passed back
+to KVM_SET_CLOCK_GUEST on the *same* vCPU (on the destination VM, for
+migration); vCPUs may legitimately have different TSC offsets, which would
+otherwise be silently folded into the restored KVM clock.
+
+When the KVM clock is not in "master clock" mode, for example because the
+host TSC is unreliable or the guest TSCs are oddly configured, the KVM clock
+is actually defined by the host CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW instead of the guest TSC.
+In this case, the KVM_GET_CLOCK_GUEST ioctl returns -ENODATA.

+----------------------------
+
+:Capability: KVM_CAP_CLOCK_GUEST
+:Architectures: x86_64
+:Type: vcpu ioctl
+:Parameters: struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info (in)
+:Returns: 0 on success, <0 on error
+
+Sets the KVM clock (for the whole VM) in terms of the vCPU TSC, using the
+pvclock structure as returned by KVM_GET_CLOCK_GUEST. This allows the precise
+arithmetic relationship between guest TSC and KVM clock to be preserved by
+userspace across migration.
+
+When the KVM clock is not in "master clock" mode, and the KVM clock is actually
+defined by the host CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, this ioctl returns -ENODATA. Userspace
+may choose to set the clock using the less precise KVM_SET_CLOCK ioctl, or may
+choose to fail, denying migration to a host whose TSC is misbehaving. A host
+whose CPU TSC frequency is unknown (only possible without
+X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC) is never in "master clock" mode, so it also returns
+-ENODATA.
+
+If the mul/shift fields of the provided pvclock structure encode a TSC
+frequency inconsistent with the vCPU's actual TSC frequency, this ioctl
+returns -ERANGE.
+
+If the vCPU's current TSC is behind the tsc_timestamp in the provided
+structure, this ioctl returns -EINVAL. Restore the guest TSC (which the
+documented migration procedure keeps monotonic) before invoking it.
+The padding fields must be zero, the version field must be zero, and
+no flags beyond PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT are accepted; anything else
+returns -EINVAL.
