From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

When no coherent (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TSC) pair was available,
kvm_xen_start_timer() computed one from separate ktime_get() and
rdtsc() calls rather than using get_kvmclock_ns(), with a comment
explaining that the latter had a systemic error from scaling host TSC
directly to nanoseconds instead of scaling to the guest TSC first.

Commit abdef42276d8 ("KVM: x86: Fix KVM clock precision in
get_kvmclock() with TSC scaling") removed that systemic error: in
master clock mode, get_kvmclock_ns() now scales the host TSC delta to
the guest TSC and converts it with the guest's own mul/shift,
computing precisely what the guest would.

The fallback is also nearly unreachable. It sits behind the
use_master_clock check, so on 32-bit (where the master clock is never
active) it is dead code, and on 64-bit kvm_get_monotonic_and_clockread()
can only fail there if the host clocksource changed after the last
master clock update, in the window before the resulting masterclock
update is processed. In exactly that window get_kvmclock_ns() takes
its raw-clock fallback path rather than the guest TSC computation,
which is continuous with the last valid snapshot — though up to
~0.1ppm of the snapshot's age (multiplier quantization) away from the
guest's own pvclock arithmetic — and tolerable for the timers that
can be started before the pending masterclock update lands (the
clocksource change is noticed via a two-stage deferral, so it is not
strictly one).

Drop it and fall back to the existing get_kvmclock_ns() path.
