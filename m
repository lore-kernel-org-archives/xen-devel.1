I apologize for the tone of my last message which I wrote before I saw this message.
(Unfortunately some of your messages are going to the spam folder, I will try to fix
that, but it seems aol.com's spam filters are not all that smart)

I was really hoping you would answer this question and I appreciate that you are
able to give me a tentative answer favoring option 1. 

To follow up on what I did say in the last message, I think we have exhausted what
you and I can agree on and now would be a good time to pause this discussion and
I will write a new version of the Qemu patches and v3 of this patch assuming what
I said in option 1, and hopefully the Qemu maintainers will help us out by replying
to a version of the Qemu patches that does the patching of the OpRegion in Qemu instead
of in hvmloader. So far none of the Qemu maintainers have replied to my Qemu patches,
unfortunately, but ultimately, we at some point will need their input to decide how
best to do this, so until they respond to the Qemu patchsets I posted, I think we
just have to wait now until they weigh in with their thoughts and opinions.
