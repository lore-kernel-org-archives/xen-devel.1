Modern Intel IGD devices do not work well with the current implementation of
support for the Intel IGD in hvmloader because it lacks support for an
extended video bios table (VBT).

Code 43 errors in Windows guests and failure of the guest screen to light up
are some of the problems that occur with the current implementation.

To address this problem, this patch implements support for Intel IGD devices
with an extended VBT and OpRegion version 2+ which is required for most modern
Intel IGD devices, as noted in the Linux kernel vfio commits referenced in the
Link tags below. This patch ports support for devices with an extended VBT and
OpRegion 2+ which was added in those commits for KVM/vfio, but adapted for Xen
HVM guests with PCI passthrough.

This patch depends on compatible support in the device model. If hvmloader
detects the device model lacks such support, it will fall back to the
currently implemented protocol for configuring the OpRegion to provide
backward compatibiltiy for systems that lack a device model with support for
an extended VBT.

The primary reason the OpRegion needs to be patched in some cases is that with
the addition of the RVDA and RVDS fields to the OpRegion, the OpRegion is not
position-independent and may need to be patched if it is moved to a different
address in the guest. This means the current protocol of having the device
model directly map the unmodified host OpRegion to the guest is not compatible
with the requiremnts of the newer devices that in some cases require that the
OpRegion be modified for it to be compatible with the guest address space.

In this implementation, the device model has the responsibility to read the
host OpRegion and patch it as needed before exposing it to the guest. Since an
extended VBT means more pages are needed for the OpRegion, depending on the
size of the extended VBT, hvmloader has the responsibility to edit the E820
map to accomodate the additional pages needed to contain the OpRegion + VBT.

To implement this in hvmloader, use a variable, igd_opregion_e820_pages,
instead of the constant, IGD_OPREGION_PAGES, to represent the number of pages
to reserve in the E820 map for the OpRegion + VBT. Also, to remove the
confusion introduced by setting IGD_OPREGION_PAGES to 3 in an earlier patch
to account for the fact that the OpRegion is not guaranteed to be aligned on
a page boundary, reset IGD_OPREGION_PAGES to 2 so it matches the actual size
of the OpRegion.

Instead of only writing to the PCI_INTEL_OPREGION register, first read from it
to provide a way for both hvmloader and the device model to discover if both
components have support for an extended VBT and more than 3 pages reserved for
the OpRegion + VBT. The device model detects the read of the register before
the write to learn that hvmloader has support, and hvmoader detects that the
device model returns the number of pages to reserve for the OpRegion + VBT
instead of 0 when it first reads the register to learn that that the device
model has support. When this new protocol is supported by both hvmloader and
the device model, the device model will not expose the host OpRegion directly
to the guest via a direct mapping as the old protocol does but instead exposes
an emulated copy of the OpRegion and VBT using its ioreq server. This has the
added benefit of preventing extraneous host memory in the regions before or
after a non-page-aligned OpRegion that should be confidential to the host from
being exposed to the guest.

Testing reveals that when the device model exposes the OpRegion to the guest
by mapping it to the device model's ioreq server, the Windows Intel IGD
graphics dirvers are unable to access the OpRegion and report Code 43 errors
with the result being that the guest screen never lights up. So after the
device model exposes the OpRegion to the guest using its ioreq server, make a
copy of it and use a copy of the OpRegion and VBT which is backed by RAM
allocated to the guest instead of mapped via the ioreq server. This fixes the
Code 43 errors reported by the Windows IGD graphics drivers.

The companion patch for the Qemu device model (DM) is available here:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20260911072453.46256-7-brchuckz@aol.com/

That patch is part of a larger patch series available here:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20260911072453.46256-1-brchuckz@aol.com/

Up-to-date specifications for the Intel IGD are not available to the public
but an older version is available from Intel here:

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/opregion-specification.html

This patch derives the specifications for the OpRegion that are needed to
add support for an extended VBT from the patches to the Linux kernel vfio
driver. This mainly consists of the RVDA and RVDS fieds of the OpRegion which
store the address and size of the extended VBT, respectively. See the links
in the commit message which provide links to the vfio patches that added
support for this feature to KVM/VFIO guests for more details.

There is an undocumented setting that works in the xl.cfg(5) domain
configuration file, firmware_override, that makes it possible to use
a patched version of hvmloader alongside an installation of unpatched
upstream Xen or a version of Xen packaged by a distro. So one can
download the source for one's installed version of Xen, apply this
patch and build just hvmloader and then install the patched version of
hvmloader with a different filename, such as hvmloader-igd-testing, into
the same directory where hvmloader is installed (usually something like
/usr/libexec/xen/boot) and then one can configure a guest to use the patched
version of hvmloader with one's installed version of Xen by adding a line
like this to the domain xl.cfg file:

firmware_override = 'hvmloader-igd-testing'

The compatible patch for the DM is part of a larger patchset that fixes
many of the problems that currently affect the feature of Intel IGD
passthrough to Xen HVM guests. This patch should be considered as a companion
patch to that patchset for the DM. Do not try to test this patch with a real
Intel IGD device without also applying the patchset for the DM because without
those patches, the guest will most likely fail to start if an Intel IGD is
passed through to the guest.

Changes in v4:
  - Now this patch is the first patch of a 2-patch series
  - Correct a spelling mistake in the commit message: beneift -> benefit
  - Added a link to the cover letter of the latest version of the companion
    Qemu device model patch series.

Changes in v3:
  - The patch has been substantially re-worked. Most of the implementation
    of support for Intel IGD in v2 that could be implemented in the DM
    instead of in hvmloader has been moved to the DM. Specifically, the
    responsibility to read the OpRegion and patch it if necessary is done in
    the DM instead of in hvmloader. This change is in response to the
    comments that were made on v2 of this patch.

  - In contrast to both the current implementation and the implementation
    in v2, the host OpRegion is never directly exposed to the guest. Instead,
    the DM exposes an emulated copy of the OpRegion to the guest, patched
    appropriately for the guest, using the DM's ioreq server.

  - Hvmloader's main responsibility is to allocate enough pages in the E820
    map to accomodate both the OpRegion and the extended VBT. In v3, hvmloader
    relies on the DM to communicate the number of pages that are needed for
    the OpRegion + VBT, and this change means all the code in v2 related to
    discovering the size of the extended VBT has been removed from hvmloader
    in v3 and moved to the DM.

  - Backward compatibility with versions of the DM that do not support
    an extended VBT has been simplified. There is no need for a bitmask
    setting to indicate support for extended VBT and OpRegion 2 and higher.
    Instead, the DM learns that hvmloader has support by detecting a read of
    the OpRegion register before a write to it, and hvmloader learns that the
    DM has support if the DM returns a non-zero value, the number of pages
    needed for the OpRegion + VBT, in response to the first read by hvmloader.

  - It was necessary to retain the code that populates the pages allocated for
    the OpRegion and VBT with guest RAM and copying the OpRegion and VBT to
    that guest RAM because testing revealed that when the OpRegion and VBT are
    exposed to the guest by the DM's ioreq server, Windows graphics drivers
    are unable to access the OpRegion and VBT.

  - To remove the confusion with the value of IGD_OPREGION_PAGES that is
    currently set to 3 to account for the fact that the OpRegion is not always
    aligned on a page boundary, it has been changed in v3 to 2, the actual
    number of pages needed for the OpRegion (not including an extended VBT).

  - Added a check on the number of pages needed for the OpRegion + VBT to
    ensure the region does not take up an unreasonably large percentage of the
    reserved dynamic memory range.

I also provide the following table that hopefully helps illustrate how v3
of this patch differs from v2:

Changes in v2:
  - Correct the name of the new function in the commit message
    opregion_setup() -> intel_opregion_setup()

  - Add a link to the companion patchset for the device model

  - Describe how to use the firmware_override setting in xl.cfg(5)
    to simplify testing of this patch.

  - Correct a logical flaw that in case the size of the extended VBT
    is <= 2 pages, an extra, unnecessary page would be allocated in
    the memory hole. This correction is in the intel_opregion.c file.
