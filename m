No problem. I will format references to kernel commits the way it was done in
this commit message of commit 99794c8a8ff8 in the Xen tree that references
some Linux kernel commits unless you suggest a better way to reference Linux
kernel commits:

 xen/acpi: Import PPTT definitions from Linux

Import the Processor Properties Topology Table (PPTT) definitions
from the Linux kernel header (include/acpi/actbl2.h) into Xen.

So I would just include it in the new intel-opregion.c file. Also, maybe igd-related
declarations should be moved there too, such as the currently existing extern variable
igd_opregion_pgbase and my newly proposed extern variable igd_opregion_e820_pages,
which would mean the new header would also need to be included in hvmloader/e820.c.

Ok. I thought you were referring to the BUG() statement which fully stops
the guest.

Currently, in the device model (Qemu) we have:

    ret = xc_domain_memory_mapping(xen_xc, xen_domid,
            (unsigned long)(igd_guest_opregion >> XC_PAGE_SHIFT),
            (unsigned long)(igd_host_opregion >> XC_PAGE_SHIFT),
            XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_PAGES,
            DPCI_ADD_MAPPING);

That statement is in the igd_write_opregion(...) function in the
hw/xen/xen_pt_graphics.c file of the upstream Qemu source.

If I understand our current implementation correctly, this statement
is what gives the guest access to the host OpRegion (3 pages as defined
by XEN_PCI_INTEL_OPREGION_PAGES, and in agreement with IGD_OPREGION_PAGES
in hvmloader code). I don't think this statement makes the host OpRegion
accessible to the device model, though, so I think, if I understand your
comment in an earlier about my patch resulting in what you called a "layering
violation" correctly, that our current implementation is also guilty of this
same kind of "layering violation."

So, how do you suggest we fix that?
