From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

Previously, a guest writing different TSC values on different vCPUs could
force KVM out of master clock mode. With this change, only a frequency
mismatch disables master clock. The only ways for non-master-clock mode
to happen now are archaic hardware without a TSC-based clocksource, a
VMM that sets different TSC frequencies across vCPUs, or a guest using
the legacy MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME (addressed later in this series).

Running at a different frequency leads to systemic skew between the
clocks observed by different vCPUs, due to arithmetic precision in the
scaling, so that should indeed force the clock back onto the host's
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. But divergent TSC *offsets* are not a problem: the
KVM clock is a single VM-wide nanosecond timeline, and only its
expression in TSC cycles is per-vCPU. Each vCPU's pvclock structure is
generated by translating the shared master snapshot into that vCPU's
own TSC domain via kvm_read_l1_tsc(), so when the guest computes
system_time + (rdtsc - tsc_timestamp) * rate, its own offset is present
in both rdtsc and tsc_timestamp and cancels out. VM-scoped consumers
(KVM_GET_CLOCK, the wall clock epoch, the Xen runstate times) operate
purely in the nanosecond domain, where the offset never appears.

Only two consumers genuinely depend on the TSC offsets matching, and
both are already guarded by PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT:

 1. A guest vCPU reading a *sibling* vCPU's pvclock structure with its
    own TSC would compute garbage — precisely why commit b48aa97e3820
    ("KVM: x86: require matched TSC offsets for master clock") required
    matched offsets. But when PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT is clear, guests
    already fall back to the global last_value monotonicity clamp.

 2. The Hyper-V TSC page is a single VM-wide {scale, offset} pair, so
    it cannot represent divergent offsets. It is self-guarding:
    compute_tsc_page_parameters() refuses to populate the page unless
    PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT is set, forcing such guests onto the (safe,
    nanosecond domain) TIME_REF_COUNT MSR.

So: frequency match gates master clock eligibility, and the full TSC
match (including offset) gates only PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT, which tells
the guest it may skip cross-vCPU monotonicity enforcement.

Frequency matching is tracked with a dedicated generation counter
(cur_tsc_freq_generation) which bumps only on actual frequency changes;
each vCPU is counted once per generation via this_tsc_freq_generation.
The existing offset tracking is restructured to the same pattern, and
both counters use a consistent >= online_vcpus threshold. A vCPU set
to a different frequency and back opens a new generation each time,
and its siblings are only counted back in as they synchronize — the
migration procedure sets every vCPU, which re-latches the match as the
last one lands; frequency excursions on a subset of vCPUs are not
free, by design.

A protected vCPU's synchronization returns before
kvm_track_tsc_matching(), the only other place the match is re-latched,
so its branch re-latches the frequency match itself — the first vCPU's
own bump against the zero initial cur_tsc_khz would otherwise clear it
for the life of the VM — and raises KVM_REQ_MASTERCLOCK_UPDATE on the
transition back to matched, since no later synchronization ever runs
for a protected guest to repair a refresh taken in the window.

KVM_SET_TSC_KHZ on a vCPU which has already run does not pass through
__kvm_synchronize_tsc(), so at this point in the series it leaves the
frequency-match state stale, exactly as it previously left the offset
match stale; the later patch "KVM: x86: Re-synchronize TSC after
KVM_SET_TSC_KHZ" funnels it through the invalidation.

The divergent-offset behaviour is exercised by pvclock_migration_test:
vCPUs with TSCs offset by ±0.5-1s keep the master clock, lose
PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT, and still agree on the KVM clock to within a
nanosecond, before and after a simulated live migration.
