Yes, I agree that v3 of the patch to hvmloader should presume that the DM can get
a copy of the OpRegion and read its contents so most of this can be done in the
DM instead of in hvmloader. So from hvmloader's perspective, the patch will be more
about avoiding the layering violation than anything else.
