Do you mean "onlining of memory from user space first took a),
followed by b)"?

Can you mention that you fixed this in later patches?


The series looks good to me. Feel free to add my reviewed-by:

In [1], and it was decided to not make use of device_hotplug_lock, but
rather to enforce a locking order.

The problems I spotted related to this:

1. Memory block device attributes: While .state first calls
   mem_hotplug_begin() and the calls device_online() - which takes
   device_lock() - .online does no longer call mem_hotplug_begin(), so
   effectively calls online_pages() without mem_hotplug_lock.

2. device_online() should be called under device_hotplug_lock, however
   onlining memory during add_memory() does not take care of that.

In addition, I think there is also something wrong about the locking in

3. arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/memtrace.c calls offline_pages()
   without locks. This was introduced after 30467e0b3be. And skimming over
   the code, I assume it could need some more care in regards to locking
   (e.g. device_online() called without device_hotplug_lock - but I'll
   not touch that for now).</pre>
