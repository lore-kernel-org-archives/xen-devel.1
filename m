From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

The 1-second "slop" heuristic in kvm_synchronize_tsc() is only
supposed to apply between successive userspace TSC writes, i.e. once
kvm->arch.user_set_tsc has been set by a previous write. The kernel's
own internal TSC synchronization on vCPU creation (and frequency
changes) must not arm it, otherwise the first genuine userspace write
falling within 1 second of virtual cycle time of the kernel's default
generation is "corrected" back to that generation instead of being
honoured — breaking the restore of a guest with less than one second
of runtime.

Add a test which creates a vCPU and immediately performs a first
host-initiated write of a TSC value corresponding to ~500ms of guest
runtime, then verifies the value reads back exactly (modulo elapsed
time) rather than being snapped back to the kernel's default
generation near zero.

In the frequency-change case, a buggy kernel carries the creation-rate
TSC across the change, where (expressed at the halved rate) it reads as
the creation-to-change plus creation-to-read time; a further timing
gate keeps that sum comfortably below the written 500ms so a
snapped-back value can never sit above the written one.

Both cases report through the kselftest TAP machinery; an
inconclusive case (host timing repeatedly too slow, a property of
host load rather than of the kernel under test) is recorded as a skip
without discarding the other case's result. A conclusively buggy
kernel still fails via TEST_ASSERT before any skip is reachable.
