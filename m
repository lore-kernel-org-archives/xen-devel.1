So you have a kernel thread running for 11 minutes without a schedule?

You could still put in a cond_resched_tasks_rcu_qs() in that loop. But I
guess you are trying to get rid of doing that too.

So basically if the preemption happens outside of core or module text
(which should be the case of any dynamically allocated trampoline), the
task is marked to be in the grace period across its schedule, so that the
RCU_TASK cannot move forward?

Note, there has been some work in the past (and may happen again in the
future) that will remove the preempt_disable() from the trace_recursion
locking. If that happens, then I believe the trace_recursion would need to
increment (and decrement) your counter. Probably need a comment there to
let whomever know about it if they decide to remove the preempt_disable().

I don't know. It may work, but I have a feeling there's a devil in the
details here that is waiting to bite us in the underside when we are not
(RCU) watching.
