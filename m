Hi Jan,

Thank you for your review.

Well, your first question is quite provocative. Certainly more
social/legal than technical.

I presume by "all this" you mean code in this patch such as:

#define IGD_OPREGION_RVDA 0x3ba
#define IGD_OPREGION_RVDS 0x3c2
#define IGD_OPREGION_VERSION 0x16

which defines the offsets of the rvda, rvds, and version fields from
the base address of the Intel OpRegion.

Also, I presume that "all this" includes the meaning of the 8-byte
rvda value, the meaning of the 4-byte rvds value, and the meaning of
the 2-byte version value.

So my answer is as follows:

I do not have access to the official spec that defines "all this" but
I do have access, as does the general public, to the Linux kernel's
implementation of support for the Intel IGD from many sources such as
git.kernel.org. The Linux kernel has enough accurate information about
the spec of "all this" to provide very good support for the Intel IGD
on bare metal.

To elaborate a bit more, the spec of "all this" can be derived from the
Linux kernel code that supports the Intel IGD. It would certainly be better
to have the official spec from Intel, but alas, as far as I can tell, it
is a proprietary spec that is most likely only available to Intel's OEM
customers who need the spec to write the firmware for these devices. Of
course we could ask Intel for the spec because we write firmware for these
Intel IGD devices too. How do you think that would go? You, as the maintainer
of Xen firmware that (at least implicitly in xl.cfg man pages, etc.) claims
to support the Intel IGD, certainly have the right to ask them for the spec.
Me, as a lowly customer/user of a handful of their devices at most, probably
has less of a right to ask them for the spec.

The situation here is analogous to Xen support for the Processor Properties
Topology Table referenced in a commit that you Acked [1] just a few weeks
ago. I presume you Acked that commit not because it is based on an official,
open spec of the Processor Properties Topology Table that is available to
the public, but because it is based on Linux kernel code that supports
the Processor Properties Topology Table.

[1] https://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=commit;h=99794c8a8ff8b1d277c09d4736384fd5bb94f2d6

So it was acceptable to use a spec of the Processor Properties Topology
Table derived from Linux kernel code as the basis for a commit to the Xen
codebase just a few weeks ago. Why would it not also be acceptable to use
an updated spec for the Intel IGD OpRegion and VBT derived from Linux kernel
code in the code for tools/hvmloader in the Xen codebase that already
has code that is based on the spec for older versions of the Intel IGD
OpRegion and VBT?

Yes, I could add a comment, probably a long one, to explain this
oddity. It is a problem of backward compatibility where we have a
definition, IGD_OPREGION_PAGES, that is currently set to 3 both here
in hvmloader and in the Qemu DM, but should be 2 because the OpRegion
size is really exactly two pages but the current implementation set it
to 3 because the host OpRegion is not always aligned on a 4k page
boundary so three pages are needed to map the entire host OpRegion to
the guest. I could re-write the patch setting IGD_OPREGION_PAGES to 2
and avoid a comment here, but that would complicate the logic of how
igd_opregion_e820_pages is calculated and probably introduce the need
for comments in other places. 

I am open to suggestions about how best to handle the backward compatibility
problem and the problem of ensuring compatibility between hvmloader support
for Intel IGD passthrough and DM support for that same feature. For now,
however, I am trying to keep what is applicable to the current implementation,
and this odd value of 3 for IGD_OPREGION_PAGES is one of those things
I am keeping for backward compatibility.

Perhaps the best solution would be to presume there are so few current
users of this feature that we do not need to worry about backward
compatibility and breaking existing setups. I say this because the code
here in hvmloader and in Qemu upstream to support Intel IGD passthrough
is very badly bit rotten and I doubt there are very many, if any, working
implementations currently in the wild based on unpatched vanilla Xen/Qemu
upstream code, particularly with more modern Intel IGD devices and more
recent versions of Qemu. If you give your blessing, then I can rework the
patch without worrying so much about backward compatibility and about what
happens when a guest is configured with a version of hvmloader that has
this patch and a version of the DM that lacks the compatible patch, and vice
versa, that is, when hvmloader lacks support instead of the DM lacking
support. Then we could completely remove this oddity of setting
IGD_OPREGION_PAGES to 3 in the current implementation in both hvmloader
and the Qemu DM as well as many other oddities that result from the current
implementation.

Ok I will pay more attention to CODING_STYLE. I know that libxl
has a specific CODING_STYLE document. Is there a specific one
for hvmloader? I do not see one in the tools/firmware/hvmloader
directory. I assume the one that matters for hvmloader is the
one at the top level of the Xen code source tree, not the libxl one.

We are allocating down, so as igd_opregion_e820_pages grows, igd_opregion_base
will shrink. The danger is that igd_opregion_base will go below the minimum
possible value that is compatible with our memory map. I could add a check for
that. I think our memory map allows for tens if not hundreds of pages in the
region where the OpRegion and VBT are located, and typically the OpRegion + VBT
is only about 4 or 5 pages. It should probably be a BUG() if somehow we detected
a VBT whose size was large enough to cause this problem.

I think you are right that we only do the setup once so I will
drop static here. I still think if I drop static I will want to
initialize these to zero later, because (correct me if I am wrong)
only static variables are initialized to zero if not explicitly
initialized, and without either static or an initialized value,
these would be initialized to some undetermined random value
until explicitly set to the desired initial value. Of the two,
I think that the more important one to intitialize to zero is
rvda_host, because I use an initial value of zero for that variable
to test for the case when we do not need extended VBT support.

Well, that is how it is now. I am only retaining it to maintain backward
compatiblily with DM versions that do not support the extended VBT and
OpRegion 2+. My previous comment about backward compatibilty and DM
compatibility also applies here. If we don't worry about that, we can do
away with any cases where we are permanently mapping the host opregion to
the guest and implement this new approach of always exposing a copy of
the OpRegion and VBT to the guest instead.

I think some message is needed here to indicate the incompatibility of
versions of the DM that do not support the extended VBT with versions
of hvmloader that do, especially if we are not going to worry as much
about the backward compatibility / DM compatibility problem I mentioned
multiple times in previous comments above.

This message could encourage upgrading the DM to a version that supports
the extended VBT instead of just giving this scary notification.

Also, I will more carefully read CODING_STYLE and try to fix all those
issues you have pointed out (and any others I might find).

The only way I could separate the declaration from the statement would be
to drop the const modifier because if I do:

    const uint32_t igd_host_opregion_page_offset;
...
    igd_host_opregion_page_offset = igd_host_opregion &
                                    IGD_OPREGION_MASK;

The compiler will report an error. If I drop the const modifier from
the declaration, the compiler will not report an error but I lose the
protection the compiler gives me from making mistakes by modifying a
variable's value that should be constant.

I am not a C guru but some research indicates that while it is legal in
C to declare a variable with the const modifier without also assigning
it a value at the same time with a statement, it is not recommended to
do this because the variable will be initialized with some undefined
random value that cannot be changed because we used the const modifier
in the declaration. This implies strict enforcemnt of the rule "we
don't mix declarations and statements" results also in the corollary
rule "we never use the const modifier for variables in C."

Yeah, this is an issue. Other device models that intend to support
the Intel IGD with hvmloader will also have to be compatible with this.
It would be easier if we did not have to worry about backward
compatibility and supporting what we had in the codebase for many years
in both hvmloader and Qemu and we would not need IGD_OPREGION2_SUPPORT_MASK
in that case. Instead, we would just completely deprecate all previous
implementations of the Intel IGD passthrough feature in both hvmloader and
the Qemu DM as unsupported. So my previous comments about backward
compatibility apply here again.

Would it be OK to just get rid of the error message here?

The size of the VBT, rvds, is the same on both host and guest, so we do not
need to specify host or guest, but the base address of the VBT, rvda, is
not the same on the guest as it is on the host, so we need to specify which
one for rvda. I can change this to rvds_host_page_offset because it is
not wrong, but it might be confusing because I use that value later on
for computations involving the guest also.

Actually, I only use rvds_page_offset below to help decide whether or not to
retain the host OpRegion page offset in the guest. I don't know if this is
necessary, though, and I could test without retaining the same page offset in
the guest and always place the both the OpRegion and the VBT on a page
boundary in the guest (if I place the OpRegion on a page boundary and
also always place the VBT contiguous after the OpRegion, the VBT will
always be placed exactly two pages after the base of the OpRegion and thus
also on a page boundary). All the devices I test have enough room to retain
the page offset of the host in the guest without requiring allocation of
an extra page, so if there are regressions I will notice them in my testing.
If always placing OpRegion and VBT on a page boundary works with no regressions,
then I could completely remove rvds_page_offset from the code. I will still
need rvda_host_page_offset though, because it is needed to get the exact
location of the VBT in the guest when the DM temporarily maps the host VBT
to the guest.

The DM cannot access the host rvda value because it is only accessible
from the host kernel, and the DM is only a user-space process on the host.
The KVM/vfio solution is to have the kernel vfio driver provide rvda to
Qemu, and I think it would be possible for the xen-pciback kernel driver
to also expose rvda to the DM, but that would likely require patches to
the kernel xen-pciback driver and probably also to libxl or other toolstack
which uses QMP to plug the Xen PCI passthrough devices into the PCI bus
provided by the DM. This solution avoids needing to touch libxl and kernel
drivers.

Ok. It should always be a multiple of four spaces, I presume. I admit I did
