I agree that having the spec at hand would be better. To be more precise, I
can say that what this patch essentially does is port the support for
the extended VBT with OpRegion 2+ for the Intel IGD passthrough that exists
in KVM/vfio to Xen. Should I explicitly say in the title of the commit
message that this is a port of KVM/vfio support for extended VBT to Xen?

No, I do not expect every reader to decipher the underlying information...

That is why I provided these two links at the bottom of the commit message.
Perhaps you did not notice them:

Link: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20211012124855.52463-1-colin.xu@gmail.com/
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20210325170953.24549-1-fred.gao@intel.com/

They are the patches to the vfio kernel driver that added support for the
extended VBT for KVM/vfio guests. I could provide links to more patches, such
as the ones in Qemu, Seabios, and patches provided by Intel to support extended
VBT in builds of OVMF for the Qemu/KVM platform, but I thought the two patches
above are sufficient for the purpose of this patch. For example, in those patches,
the #defines I added to config.h in hvmloader are included in the two links
I added to the bottom of the commit message.

I think adding more patches to the commit message would make it more difficult to
decipher the essential information needed to do this port of support from KVM/vfio
to Xen. Those two patches are not so large and they do provide the information
needed to add support for the extended VBT on a virtualization platform such
as KVM or Xen. How best to implement such support for the current Xen platform
is what we should focus on in these discussion.

It may take a while to arrive at what exactly the message should say here.
I will think about it and propose what seems reasonable in the next version.

Ok.

Ok. Perhaps the IGD_* defines could be moved to a public header to define the
interface to be used to support the Intel IGD. Would it be OK to move those
to a separate igd.h header and include it in hvmloader/config.h?

I don't think I understand what you mean by "No full stop in messages..."

We have code like this in hvmloader/e820.c:

    if ( rc || !nr_entries )
    {
        printf("Get guest memory maps[%d] failed. (%d)\n", nr_entries, rc);
        BUG();
    }

I think the host OpRegion is not currently accessible by the DM. On the KVM
platform, this is made possible via the kernel vfio driver and then Qemu exposes
the OpRegion to the guest using the Qemu FwCfg device interface. How should we make
the OpRegion and VBT accessible to the device model and then, to the guest, on Xen?
I think it could be done via the xen-pciback kernel driver. Should we do that
instead? I think to do that we would have to convince the kernel developers that
the Intel OpRegion, as you say, "should" be accessible by the Xen device model.
I can imagine them saying, why not use the vfio driver?

Teddy Astie, on the Cc: list for this patch, is actually working on this:

https://xcp-ng.org/blog/2024/04/18/iommu-paravirtualization-for-xen/

These decisions about the best approach to support the Intel IDG on Xen are
above my pay grade, obviously. I need some guidance here, please.

Ok.
