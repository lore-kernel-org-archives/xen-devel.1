Moreover, I tried accessing the OpRegion using /dev/mem and mmap using a
little C program, dumpmem, [1] I found but it does not work in either dom0
or in the guest when IGD is passed through to the guest: mmap returns
MAP_FAILED and reports the EPERM error: Operation not permitted. So it looks
like Qemu cannot access the OpRegion using mmap and /dev/mem with current
Linux kernels. So I am still skeptical that with current Linux kernel
implementation and its hardening mechanisms such as CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, it
is not possible for Qemu to directly access the OpRegion without also adding a
patch to either Linux or Xen to provide access of OpRegion contents to Qemu. 

But the good news is I did find a way to dump the OpRegion to a file from
either dom0 or the guest when passed through, but in dom0 it works only before
xl makes the device assignable for passthrough and bound to xen-pciback, so that
is not so helpful since we need Qemu to access it when the IGD is assigned to
its guest and bound to the xen-pciback kernel driver.

Here is how I accessed the OpRegion from dom0 userland before xl assigns it
for Xen PCI passthrough:

Linux debugfs mentioned in the man page for IGT GPU tools [2] exposes the OpRegion:

https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/intel-gpu-tools/intel_vbt_decode.1.en.html

Here is how to dump the OpRegion contents to a file in the home directory:

user@dom0:~$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.0/i915_opregion > ~/i915_opregion
user@dom0:~$ ls -l ~/i915_opregion
-rw-r--r--. 1 chuckz chuckz 8192 Aug 18 22:41 /home/chuckz/i915_opregion
user@dom0:~$

There it is, the 8k OpRegion dumped to a file.

This also works for the VBT:

user@dom0:~$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.0/i915_vbt > ~/i915_vbt
user@dom0:~$ ls -l ~/i915_vbt
-rw-r--r--. 1 chuckz chuckz 8704 Aug 18 22:48 /home/chuckz/i915_vbt
user@dom0:~$

So now, with a copy of both the OpRegion and VBT, I can write and test
patches to hvmloader and Qemu using your approach of exposing a copy
and never mapping the host OpRegion to the guest and in that way avoid the
layering violation. The TODO is to find a way for Qemu to get a copy of
the OpRegion on the fly instead of only after the administrator places
a copy of it in the dom0 filesystem where Qemu can access it.

I think one way to make the OpRegion directly accessible to Qemu instead
of being accessible only after dumping it to a file and placing the dumped
file where Qemu can access it would be to provide a xen-intelgpuback kernel
driver whose job would be to make the OpRegion and VBT accessible to Qemu
when the device is assigned to a Xen HVM guest.
