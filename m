Ah, I see this message is the one you sent me earlier today about this patch and now
the list archive has caught up so for those who might be reading this thread here
is the link:

https://lore.kernel.org/xen-devel/92022f85-9a53-4db8-b489-fc91c86b413c@suse.com/

Well, I did try to answer this question here:

https://lore.kernel.org/xen-devel/fa497825-c8f0-4caf-94f5-b37108e31952@aol.com/

My answer is based on the fact, as far as I understand it, the ASLS register
on the real hardware is not touched when the guest writes to it because in our
case the register is fully emulated and the guest can only access and write to or
read from the emulated virtual register, not the real register on the hardware.

Also, we have this code in Qemu (hw/xen/xen_pt_config_init.c):

static XenPTRegInfo xen_pt_emu_reg_igd_opregion[] = {
    /* Intel IGFX OpRegion reg */
    {
        .offset     = 0x0,
        .size       = 4,
        .init_val   = 0,
        .emu_mask   = 0xFFFFFFFF,
        .u.dw.read   = xen_pt_intel_opregion_read,
        .u.dw.write  = xen_pt_intel_opregion_write,
    },

Do you see that emu_mask setting of 0xFFFFFFFF? As I understand it, that means
that all 32 bits of the register are emulated, and none of the bits are passed
through to the real device.

Also, I can quote from the (admittedly outdated) spec for the OpRegion that is
available online [1] which says this about the ASLS register of the IGD PCI device
in section 5.1.2 of that document:

> This register is a software scratch register and is not used by hardware
> other than to hold the state software has set.

I think this means that even if the real hardware register on the device was exposed
to the guest and the guest wrote a different address to the register, it would
*not* "move" the host OpRegion anywhere because, as the spec says, the register is
not used by hardware but by software (the system BIOS software) to let the graphics
driver know where it can find the OpRegion. But the guest *cannot* access the real
ASLS register on the device in our implementation nor in my proposed implementation
in v2 of this patch or in any of the other ways to solve this problem that we
have discussed in this thread.

So I don't understand how the question you raise poses a serious problem.

But if you are not an expert on the PCI specification and how the PCI config space
registers can be programmed with emulated bits and passthrough bits, and if you
don't trust my understanding of it either, then I think we need to wait for
experts on the PCI specification to weigh in and answer your question before we
can move forward.

    To actually see the spec, click on the "OpRegion Specification" link in the page
    shown above and download the pdf file that link points to. It is still live, I
    checked it today.
