From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

This is the second half of the KVM clock series which has been churning
since about 2024. The first half¹ is upstream as of 7.4-rc1 (yay!).  This is
the remainder — the masterclock overhaul, and new API for fixing migration.

Sashiko is helping by finding lots of things which have been fairly hosed
in kvmclock since its inception, as well as things I've managed to screw
up for myself along the way.

As of v12, a guest can no longer force the KVM clock out of masterclock
mode at all. Even the old SYSTEM_TIME MSR (and that SUSE kernel from 2006)
is satisfied by updating the master clock when the MSR is rewritten.

Tree: https://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/linux.git/shortlog/refs/heads/kvmclock13

v13 follows one more on-list sashiko round, a second 0day report⁴, and
eleven rounds of review-and-fixup with sashiko locally. Two
pre-existing bugs the review flushed out are split out as standalone
fixes with Fixes: tags (new patches 7 and 9), so the series is now 26
patches. In detail:

KVM_SET_TSC_KHZ:
 • The {guest TSC, host clock} tuple could be sampled just before a sibling
   opened a newer generation, wrapping the elapsed time — and the first
   fix, clamping it to zero, inflated the matching error from |F1-F2|·Δt
   to F1·Δt, spuriously splitting the generation when two vCPUs raced
   through the ioctl.
 • The 1ms matching window for exact kernel-internal samples was
   unreachable unless userspace had already written a TSC.
 • preempt_disable() did not actually make the fallback {TSC, ns} read
   pair coherent; interrupts could still land between the two reads.
 • A creation-time frequency the hardware cannot scale to left the vCPU
   with virtual_tsc_khz == 0 for its whole life.
 • An internal preserved sample of exactly zero took the userspace
   zero-write path and was snapped onto the generation line.
 • A forced synchronization of an unrun vCPU racing a sibling through
   the ioctl could wrap its extrapolated TSC below zero, which an
   unstable-TSC host then re-anchored the guest TSC to at vcpu_load.
 • The 1ms window computation needed libgcc's __udivdi3 on i386 (kernel
   test robot⁴).
 • The fix for stale always-catchup state is now its own patch with a
   Fixes: tag, since the bug predates this series (new patch 9), as is
   the fix for the Hyper-V TSC page latching stale parameters from a
   superseded snapshot (new patch 7).

The master clock:
 • A scaled protected guest TSC (TDX, SNP Secure TSC) left the master
   clock computing with the host's unscaled frequency.
 • The first protected-TSC synchronization cleared the frequency match
   for the life of the VM, since such vCPUs never reach
   kvm_track_tsc_matching() to re-latch it — and the re-latch then had to
   raise the masterclock update itself, or a refresh racing a second
   vCPU's creation latched the master clock off forever.
 • An aborted vCPU creation could clear matched state which a racing
   host-initiated TSC write on the already-live fd had made correct, and
   for a protected-TSC first vCPU it skipped the snapshot refresh forever.
 • KVM_GET_CLOCK's no-vCPU staleness check compared two reads nothing
   kept coherent, so a reader preempted for a second mid-ioctl served the
   flag-less fallback from a healthy snapshot.
 • Deduplicated masterclock updates removed the accidental heal for a
   Hyper-V TSC page rewritten from a stale snapshot: a vCPU preempted
   between its pvclock read and the page write consumed the HOST_CHANGED
   mark against the old snapshot and set HV_TSC_PAGE_SET, permanently.
   kvm_hv_setup_tsc_page() now revalidates the pvclock seqcount under
   its own lock, and the updater re-marks the page once the new snapshot
   is published.
 • The CLOCK_UPDATE broadcast sat inside the pvclock seqcount write
   section, growing the interrupts-off window with the vCPU count.
 • A CPU hotplug runs the backwards-TSC compensation while vCPU threads
   are live, and the unlocked consume of tsc_offset_adjustment in
   vcpu_load could discard a delta the generation reference kept.
 • kvm_vm_ioctl_set_clock()'s epoch-wrap guard left the anchor off
   master_kernel_ns, wrapping system_time for a near-zero clock instead.
 • Patch 12's subject and opening described an earlier patch's work; it
   is now "Keep the master clock trustworthy while the VM has no vCPUs".

KVM_[GS]ET_CLOCK_GUEST:
 • GET after a host suspend with the VM paused combined the post-resume
   offset with the pre-suspend snapshot — frequencies still matched, so
   the destination accepted garbage. GET now services the vCPU's pending
   masterclock update first, and fails with -ENODATA.

Elsewhere:
 • The TSC migration documentation's step 7b multiplication wraps a
   signed 64-bit value after ~51 minutes of pause at 3GHz; it now carries
   the same 128-bit note as step 2d, and the exemplar selftest does the
   arithmetic in 128 bits.
 • Selftests reported a loaded host as a kernel regression instead of a
   TAP skip, printed no TAP output at all, carried a fourth private copy
   of the pvclock arithmetic, and the divergent-offset correction check
   could not fail against a silently ignored KVM_SET_CLOCK_GUEST.
 • The CPUID timing test's ratio cross-check skip keyed off the very
   ratio it exists to verify, and the first-write test's
   frequency-change arm could pass on a buggy kernel under adverse
   scheduling.
 • The clock library helpers now also convert the pre-existing
   open-coded call sites.
 • Various comments and commit messages overclaimed ("invisible to any
   correct guest", "definitely identical", "the only synchronization a
   protected vCPU ever performs") and have been made honest.
