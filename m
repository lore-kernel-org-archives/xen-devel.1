From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

I love it when sashiko-bot finds things that my own local sashiko run didn't.

This is the second half of the KVM clock series which has been churning
since about 2024. The first half¹ is upstream as of 7.4-rc1 (yay!).  This is
the remainder — the masterclock overhaul, and new API for fixing migration.

In v12 I've finally removed the last reason why a *guest* can force the KVM
clock out of masterclock mode (by using the old SYSTEM_TIME MSR). Even if we
do still care about that SUSE kernel from 2015, we can satisfy it just by
updating the master clock when it rewrites the MSR.

Tree: https://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dwmw2/linux.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/kvmclock12

Since v11², fixing what the on-list review found, and more that arose out of
that:

KVM_SET_TSC_KHZ:
 • Synchronizing during vCPU creation, before the vCPU is counted in
   online_vcpus, corrupted the VM-wide matching state.
 • Because the user_set_tsc flag was VM-wide, restoring one vCPU's TSC made
   a sibling's *unrestored* value be preserved across a frequency change.
 • Time spent in the ioctl between sampling the guest TSC and reinstalling
   it was silently subtracted from the vCPU's clock.
 • Setting the unchanged frequency perturbed the generation tracking, and a
   failed call committed the rejected frequency anyway.
 • An above-host-rate frequency on scaling-less hardware left the vCPU in
   catchup mode forever.

The master clock:
 • Making the first vCPU match the TSC generation established at VM
   creation was a silent guest-visible change (its TSC became the cycles
   elapsed since KVM_CREATE_VM), and handed it a stale offset if the host
   suspended while the VM had no vCPUs.
 • KVM_GET_CLOCK trusted a master snapshot which nothing refreshes for a
   VM with no vCPUs across a host suspend, returning a discontinuity
   flagged KVM_CLOCK_TSC_STABLE.
 • A TSC synchronization which changed the vCPU's offset left the guest's
   pvclock unrefreshed, now that offset changes no longer turn the master
   clock off.
 • When the last vCPU reached a new common frequency, nothing refreshed
   the masterclock scaling factors.
 • A pending masterclock update on a newly created vCPU wasn't serviced
   until it first ran, and a vCPU whose creation was aborted part-way
   stayed counted as matched forever.
 • Guests using the legacy MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME lost the master clock
   entirely — the 2015 workaround for SUSE's 2.6.16 freshness heuristic,
   which is better satisfied by sliding the reference point forward when
   the legacy MSR is rewritten (new patch 24).

KVM_[GS]ET_CLOCK_GUEST:
 • The guest TSC comparison mishandled wraparound.
 • The frequency sanity check could underflow, rejected two hosts
   calibrated exactly 1kHz apart, and hvclock_to_hz() could wrap on
   absurd user-supplied mul/shift.
 • The -EBUSY case was unreachable, and GET returned from inside the
   seqcount read section.

Elsewhere:
 • kvm_vm_ioctl_set_clock() wrapped if the host clock had legally been
   set to within moments of the 1970 epoch.
 • clang couldn't see that guest_now was always initialized in
   kvm_xen_start_timer() on 32-bit builds (kernel test robot³).
 • Comments and commit messages overclaimed in places, the
   kvm_update_master_clock tracepoint still said "offsetmatched", the
   tools/ uapi header mirror had drifted, and api.rst didn't document the
   new KVM_SET_TSC_KHZ behaviour.
 • Selftests skipped on any errno rather than just -ENODATA, could pass
   on a buggy kernel under adverse scheduling, lost a whole frequency's
   coverage when hardware scaling wasn't engaged, and carried a third
   private copy of the pvclock arithmetic.
