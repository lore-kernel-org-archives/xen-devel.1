I am thinking of the case where a trampoline is interrupted before entering
(or after leaving) its RCU Tasks Trace read-side critical section.  Then
there is a softirq handler on the back of that interrupt handler, and
RCU_SOFTIRQ is invoked, calling rcu_core().  Specifically:

	/* Report any deferred quiescent states if preemption enabled. */
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT) && (!(preempt_count() & PREEMPT_MASK))) {
		rcu_preempt_deferred_qs(current);
	} else if (rcu_preempt_need_deferred_qs(current)) {
		guard(irqsave)();
		set_need_resched_current();
	}

Preemption is enabled, but we should not report a quiescent state because
we have interrupted a trampoline.  Correct?

Yes, we could avoid the list of tasks by treating the preemption within
the trampoline the same as preemption within an RCU read-side critical
section, but there might not be an rcu_read_unlock() to clean up.
Which could be a problem.

Trampolines that transfer control to tracing code could supply the needed
cleanup call.  But last I checked, there were trampolines that transferred
directly back to the original code, with no opportunity for cleaning up.

Or am I still missing a trick here?

							Thanx, Paul
