We have seen this from time to time here as well.

And we have done this a few times, but if this proves to be an acceptable

If I understand correctly, the difference with Josef's patch is
that rcu_tasks_classic_qs(current, true), when called without the
direct or indirect aid of a trampoline, will provide an RCU Tasks
quiescent state.  In contrast, without Josef's patch, no call to
rcu_tasks_classic_qs(current, true) will provide such a quiescent state.

More to the point, because rcu_tasks_classic_qs(current, false) is
invoked from rcu_note_context_switch(), any preemption to kernel code not
within or called from a trampoline will now provide a quiescent state.
Keeping in mind that cond_resched() is treated as a preemption, this
change could potentially greatly reduce the need for sprinkling calls
to cond_resched_tasks_rcu_qs() throughout the kernel.  (Except that
the call to cond_resched() has to actually invoke the scheduler for
anything to happen.)

Which, if it works, would of course be a good thing.  ;-)

We might well need more:

o	The rcu_tasks_pertask() might need to check to see if task "t"
	is in a quiescent state.  The task_call_func() function might
	be helpful in safely accessing that task's state remotely in
	the common case where the task is blocked or preempted.

o	Given a task that runs for a very long time on a CPU that has
	nothing else to do (so that cond_resched() does nothing and
	there are no preemptions), and does so in a code path that never
	invokes cond_resched_tasks_rcu_qs(), it might be necessary to IPI
	to CPU that this task is running on.  Or to invoke resched_cpu()
	in order to force a context switch on that CPU, whether it needs
	one or not.  (Which makes the scheduler do the IPI for us.)

o	PREEMPT_RT kernels might want memory ordering on the nesting count
	increments and decrements, along with READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()
	or similar, in order to avoid the aforementioned IPIs.  But this
	increases overhead, so !PREEMPT_RT kernels would *not* want this.

And probably other things that I am not yet seeing.  ;-)

Well, that is RCU for you!  ;-)
